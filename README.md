# CNOT Benchmark

# Description:

This is one of the deliverables for the project #14 QEC fidelity for cx gates of QAMP Spring 2022 (https://github.com/qiskit-advocate/qamp-spring-22/issues/14). In here, you will find some tools that were used along the project to run experiments to see how some different implementations of the CNOT gate behave in the presence of noise. Other point that we investigated here, was the impact of one noisy CNOT gate in a quantum error correction scheme and with that we are trying to create a new QEC-inspired measure of fidelity that can be calculated from theoretically derived or experimentally measured tomography of a candidate CNOT gate.
